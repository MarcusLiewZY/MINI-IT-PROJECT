          Welcome to MMU Confessions! Our community is built on the principles
          of respect, inclusivity, and collaboration. To ensure a positive and
          enjoyable experience for all members, we've established the following
          guidelines:
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="small-container">
        <div>Respect Others</div>
        <p>
          Treat fellow community members with kindness, empathy, and respect.
          Avoid personal attacks, harassment, hate speech, or any behavior that
          makes others feel unwelcome or uncomfortable.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="small-container">
        <div>Be Inclusive</div>
        <p>
          Embrace diversity and welcome individuals from all backgrounds,
          cultures, and perspectives. Avoid discrimination or exclusion based on
          factors such as race, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation,
          religion, or disability. Let's make everyone feel like they belong.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="small-container">
        <div>Keep Conversations Constructive</div>
        <p>
          You are highly encouraged to engage in meaningful and constructive
          discussions. Share ideas, ask questions, and provide constructive
          feedback in a respectful manner. Avoid disruptive behaviour, trolling,
          or intentionally derailing conversations.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="small-container">
        <div>Respect Privacy</div>
        <p>
          Respect the privacy and personal boundaries of other community
          members. Do not share personal information about others without their
          consent, and refrain from unauthorized use of private messages or
          communications.
