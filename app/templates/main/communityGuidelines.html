        <p>
          Welcome to MMU Confessions! Our community is built on the principles
          of respect, inclusivity, and collaboration. To ensure a positive and
          enjoyable experience for all members, we've established the following
          guidelines:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Respect Others</li>
          <p>
            Treat fellow community members with kindness, empathy, and respect.
            Avoid personal attacks, harassment, hate speech, or any behavior
            that makes others feel unwelcome or uncomfortable.
          </p>

          <li>Be Inclusive</li>
          <p>
            Embrace diversity and welcome individuals from all backgrounds,
            cultures, and perspectives. Avoid discrimination or exclusion based
            on factors such as race, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual
            orientation, religion, or disability. Let's make everyone feel like
            they belong.
          </p>

          <li>Keep Conversations Constructive</li>
          <p>
            You are highly encouraged to engage in meaningful and constructive
            discussions. Share ideas, ask questions, and provide constructive
            feedback in a respectful manner. Avoid disruptive behaviour,
            trolling, or intentionally derailing conversations.
          </p>

          <li>Respect Privacy</li>
          <p>
            Respect the privacy and personal boundaries of other community
            members. Do not share personal information about others without
            their consent, and refrain from unauthorized use of private messages
            or communications.
          </p>

          <li>Follow Community Guidelines</li>
          <p>
            Adhere to the platform's terms of service and community guidelines
            at all times. Familiarize yourself with the rules and policies
            governing our community, and ensure your actions align with our
            values and principles.
          </p>

          <li>Be Mindful of Content</li>
          <p>
            Share content that is relevant, appropriate, and respectful of our
            community standards. Avoid posting spam, offensive material,
            misinformation, or content that infringes upon the rights of others.
          </p>

          <li>Report Violations</li>
          <p>
            If you encounter behaviour that violates our community guidelines or
            terms of service, please report it to our moderation team promptly.
            We rely on the collective efforts of our community members to
            maintain a safe and welcoming environment for all.
          </p>

          <li>Consequences of Violations</li>
          <p>
            Violations of our community guidelines may result in consequences,
            including warnings, account suspensions, or permanent bans,
            depending on the severity of the infraction. Our moderation team
            will take appropriate action to address violations in a fair,
            consistent and transparent manner.
          </p>

          <li>Participate Responsibly</li>
          <p>
            Take responsibility for your actions and contributions to our
            community. Be mindful of the impact of your words and actions on
            others, and strive to contribute positively to our collective
            experience.
