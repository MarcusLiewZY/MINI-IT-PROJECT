## Introduction

MMU Confessions is a web application designed to allow members of the Multimedia University (MMU) community to share their confessions anonymously. Inspired by popular confession pages, this app offers a platform where users can express themselves freely while ensuring their privacy is maintained. The app is built using Flask and is intended for use in a browser.

<br>

## Background \& Context

This project serves as a capstone for students enrolled in the Foundation in Information Technology program at MMU. As a group project, it includes three to four members who selected the web development track from the available options of game development, desktop application development, and web development.

The project is conducted under the supervision of [lecturer's name], requiring regular reporting of weekly progress. The team employs an agile project management methodology, utilizing ClickUp for task management and coordination.

The expected outcomes of this project are to develop a solution to simple IT problems using programming tools and to prepare students for solving real-world problems.
